## ✅ P0 — ElevenLabs Billing Fix SHIPPED (2026-06-04)

**Root cause:** Accidental single-tap starts on the sphere generating micro-sessions.
**Fix:** Double-tap guard on `micStartFromFloat()` — first tap arms (500ms sphere flash), second tap starts the session. Single taps silently do nothing. Also: `sendContextualUpdate` tab-change notifications debounced at 30s.
**Commit:** `dcd9ef7` — live on GitHub Pages.

## Shipped
- Voice stack: ElevenLabs + Hope + Claude Sonnet 4.6
- 30 client tools
- Cross-call memory via STATE.profile
- Project OS doc migration (2026-05-20)
- **YouTube KB wired into Hope's context (2026-05-21)** — `loadYtKb()`, `buildYtKbDigest()`, `read_yt_knowledge` tool (tool 31), RT_INSTRUCTIONS updated. Smoke test passed 2026-05-21.
- **Reference tab rebuild (2026-05-25)** — WAV drop zone + transport (play/pause/stop/±10s scrub) + 2×2 meter dashboard (LUFS Int, LUFS Short-term, True Peak, Dynamic Range) + canvas spectral analyser (FabFilter-style gradient curve, live FFT + idle animation) + Platform Loudness Comparison table + True Peak Ceilings table. Committed 4be7200, live on GitHub Pages.

## In progress
- **Cloudflare Worker key relay (2026-06-11)** — code complete, awaiting Kev's one-time deploy. New `worker/` dir (Worker source + wrangler.toml + deploy guide) holds the Anthropic + ElevenLabs keys as server-side secrets and relays the app's API calls; `index.html` gained an `AIMM PROXY` shim (fetch rewrite + placeholder key seeding) plus baked-in default agent IDs seeded into localStorage — agent ID entry is no longer needed on a new device, effective immediately. `AIMM_PROXY_URL` is pre-filled with `https://aimm-proxy.kevinlelitte.workers.dev` (Kev's existing Cloudflare account). Remaining: deploy the Worker + set the two secrets — terminal or dashboard route, both in `worker/README.md` — then merge. After that a fresh browser needs zero Settings entry. Single-user security model (Origin allowlist only) — add real auth + rotate keys before sharing AIMM.
- **Smoke test: YouTube KB** — verify `[YT_KB] loaded` in console, Hope can fetch SEIDS Logic Pro 101 chunks on demand (next in-office session)
- GitHub repo rename: remote SHIPPED 2026-05-21 — local folder + path sweep IN PROGRESS

## Planned — Session 6 priorities (2026-05-26)

### ✅ P-A: Mix Check tab — SHIPPED 2026-06-04
*Commit a3d96ba*

Three changes to the current Reference tab, shipped as one:

1. **Rename** — tab label changes from "Reference" to "Mix Check". Tab id stays `eq`. `data-label` attribute on the tab button updated.

2. **Troubleshooter pills replace Reference Guides** — the two static collapsed panels (Frequency Map, Stereo Width by Band) are removed. In their place: a live troubleshooter panel using the same symptom pills as the Repair tab. Pills auto-highlight based on WAV analysis results:
   - True Peak > −1.0 dBTP → "Master clips on streaming" — red
   - True Peak > −0.5 dBTP → same pill — deeper red
   - DR < 5 → "Mix is crushed / no dynamics" — red
   - DR 5–7 → same pill — amber
   - Correlation < 0.5 → "Stereo image collapses in mono" — red
   - Correlation 0.5–0.7 → same pill — amber
   - Spectral excess sub/bass band → "Low end is muddy / woofy" — amber
   - Spectral deficit sub band → "808 doesn't hit in the car" — amber
   - Spectral excess high-mid/air → "Hi-hats too harsh" — amber
   - LUFS Int < −14 → new pill "Mix too quiet for platform" — amber
   - Multiple pills can fire simultaneously
   - Clicking any pill gives the recipe (same troubleshooter behaviour as Repair)
   - Auto-generate: if analysis detects an anomaly with no matching pill, Hope generates a one-off pill with label + suggested chain

3. **Manual input mode** — no WAV needed. Meter cards get editable fields so Kev can type in readings from his DAW meter plugins (iZotope Insight, Nugen, etc.) and trigger the same pass/fail logic + pill highlighting. Override also works when a WAV is loaded — typed value takes precedence.

**Effort:** ~3 hours (rename ~10 min, pills ~1.5 hrs, manual input ~1 hr)

---

### P-B: A/B Ref tab (new — replaces Repair slot)
*Designed 2026-05-25. Spec + mockup needed from Seat A before any code.*

The freed Repair tab slot becomes a dedicated reference track comparison surface.

- **Two inputs** — your mix (pre-loaded from Mix Check if already analysed, no re-drop needed) + a second drop zone for a reference track (WAV/AIFF from library, downloaded from Spotify/Apple Music etc.)
- **Overlaid spectral canvas** — your mix renders as the existing gradient curve; reference track renders as a dimmer white/grey curve on the same canvas. Gap between the two is immediately visible.
- **Side-by-side delta meters** — LUFS Int, True Peak, DR, Correlation shown for both tracks with a Δ badge (e.g. "your mix is +4.1 LUFS hotter"). Pass/fail colouring on both sides.
- **Hope commentary** — on demand or automatically after both files load. Uses existing Claude/AI Chat infrastructure. "Your sub is 6dB hotter than the reference. Your True Peak headroom is tighter. Highs are well-matched."
- **Shared engine** — reuses the Web Audio API pipeline, FFT analyser, canvas renderer, and meter card components already built for Mix Check.
- **Note on Spotify:** streaming audio cannot be loaded in-browser without OAuth. Practical path is Kev downloads a reference track as WAV or high-quality MP3 and drops it. Covers 99% of the use case.

**Tab name:** A/B Ref
**Tab id:** `ab` (new panel, new button)
**Effort:** ~4 hours

---

### P-C: Retire Repair tab
*Agreed 2026-05-25. Ships alongside P-A or after.*

The Repair tab (`data-tab="meter"`) becomes redundant once P-A (Mix Check pills + manual input) ships. Everything unique to Repair moves to Mix Check. The tab slot is freed for P-B (A/B Ref).

- Remove `<button class="tab" data-tab="meter">` from nav
- Remove `<div class="panel" id="meter">` and its contents
- Remove any `meter`-specific JS that doesn't serve the new tabs
- Update `switch_tab` tool enum to remove `meter`, add `ab`
- Update `buildAppKnowledgeDigest` TAB NAV catalog
- Update RT_INSTRUCTIONS references

**Effort:** ~1 hour (mostly careful deletion + search/replace)

### P-D: Hope's sphere — animated particle orb replacing floating mic
*Designed 2026-05-25. Visual mockup created — see docs/mockups/hope-sphere.html.*

The flat floating mic button becomes a living representation of Hope — a particle sphere that:

- **Idle** — slow gentle pulse, cool teal/cyan, soft glow, particles drift slowly
- **Listening** — particles quicken, colour shifts slightly warmer, gentle rotation
- **Speaking** — reacts to Hope's voice amplitude via Web Audio API analyser on the EL audio output; sphere expands/contracts with her speech rhythm
- **Thinking/processing** — particles scatter then reform, cooler blue-white
- **Emotional intensity** — colour temperature shifts: calm = teal (#06b6d4), engaged = purple (#a78bfa), emphatic = white-hot (#f0f9ff)

Implementation: canvas-based, ~150 particles, no external library. Same Web Audio API infrastructure as the spectral analyser. Still draggable/floatable, same position persistence.

Reference image provided by Kev (2026-05-25 session) — teal/cyan glowing particle sphere on black background, equatorial band detail.

**Effort:** ~3 hours

---

### P-E: Hope tools for Mix Check + A/B Ref
*Designed 2026-05-25. Depends on P-A and P-B shipping first.*

New client tools added to `TOOL_DEFS` so Hope can see and interact with both new tabs:

- `get_mix_check_state` — returns filename, LUFS Int, LUFS Short-term, True Peak, DR, Correlation, Stereo Balance, which pills are highlighted and their severity
- `set_meter_value` — manually sets a meter value (LUFS/True Peak/DR/Correlation) in the Mix Check dashboard, same as Kev typing it in
- `get_ab_ref_state` — returns both sides of A/B Ref (filenames, all meter values, delta values) when both files are loaded
- Extend `toggle_symptom` to cover Mix Check pills (currently only Repair)

Hope proactively flags issues without being asked: if True Peak is over ceiling after a file loads, she mentions it on the next voice turn.

**Effort:** ~1.5 hours (after P-A + P-B)

## Planned — carry-forward from previous sessions

### DAW Bridge Epic (3 phases)
*Inspired by EchoJay review — 2026-05-24*

**Phase 1 — Plugin Scan (companion JUCE plugin, Cowork builds)**
- Lightweight VST/AU/AAX companion plugin
- Single function: scan DAW plugin list → export `aimm-plugins.json`
- User drops JSON into AIMM → Hope confirms library update
- Existing manual/screenshot/voice input kept as fallbacks

**Phase 2 — AIMM Import Handler (index.html)**
- "Sync from DAW" button
- JSON drop/import handler
- Merges with existing plugin library

**Phase 3 — Audio Capture Bridge**
- Plugin captures snippet during DAW playback
- Sends LUFS, spectrum, dynamics to AIMM via local WebSocket
- Hope advises based on actual signal data

**Other carry-forward:**
- `ingest_yt.py` → auto-update `index.json`
- Hope KB: channel crawl continuation
- iPad PWA

## Icebox
- Five dormant personas (Matthew, Markey, Katie, Ashley, Lauren) — one-line revival ready
